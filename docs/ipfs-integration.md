# IPFS Integration: Storage, Indexing, and Retrieval

Haus uses the InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) as its primary storage layer for all content, including video streams, metadata, and RTAs. This document explains how we integrate with IPFS through Pinata, our approach to content indexing, and our retrieval mechanisms.

## Overview

Our IPFS integration serves several critical functions:

1. **Permanent Storage**: All content created on Haus is stored permanently on IPFS
2. **Content Addressing**: Each piece of content has a unique Content Identifier (CID)
3. **Decentralized Delivery**: Content can be retrieved from any IPFS node
4. **Censorship Resistance**: No central authority can remove or modify content

## Pinata Integration

We use Pinata as our IPFS pinning service for several reasons:

- **Reliability**: Pinata provides enterprise-grade reliability and uptime
- **Performance**: Dedicated gateways ensure fast content retrieval
- **Scalability**: Handles our high-volume storage needs
- **API Access**: Comprehensive API for programmatic content management

### Authentication

We authenticate with Pinata using JWT tokens:

```typescript
const PINATA_JWT = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PINATA_JWT;

// Example headers for Pinata API requests
const headers = {
  Authorization: `Bearer ${PINATA_JWT}`,
  "Content-Type": "application/json",
};
