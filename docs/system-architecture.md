# System Architecture

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Haus platform architecture, explaining how the various components interact to create a seamless experience for artists and viewers.

## High-Level Architecture

Haus is built on a hybrid architecture that combines:

1. **Decentralized Components**: Blockchain contracts, IPFS storage
2. **Centralized Services**: Streaming servers, chat services, web application
3. **Client Applications**: Web interface, mobile apps (future)

## Core Components

### Smart Contract Layer

The blockchain layer consists of three primary contracts:

1. **EventFactory**: Creates and manages events and RTAs
2. **TicketFactory**: Handles ticket sales and verification
3. **LiveTipping**: Processes tips during events

These contracts are deployed on the Solana blockchain and interact with each other through cross-program invocations (CPIs).

### Storage Layer

Content storage is handled through a multi-tiered approach:

1. **IPFS/Pinata**: Primary storage for all content
2. **On-Chain References**: CIDs stored on the blockchain
3. **CDN Cache**: Edge caching for frequently accessed content

### Streaming Infrastructure

The streaming system consists of:

1. **Ingest Servers**: RTMP servers that receive streams from artists
2. **Transcoding Service**: Converts streams to multiple qualities
3. **IPFS Upload Service**: Uploads chunks to IPFS in real-time
4. **HLS Delivery**: Delivers content via HTTP Live Streaming

### Web Application

The web application is built with:

1. **Next.js**: React framework for the frontend
2. **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
3. **Solana Wallet Adapter**: For wallet integration
4. **WebRTC**: For browser-based streaming

### Backend Services

Supporting services include:

1. **Chat Service**: WebSocket-based real-time chat
2. **Analytics Service**: Tracks viewership and engagement
3. **Notification Service**: Alerts users about events
4. **Search and Discovery**: Helps users find relevant content

## Data Flow

### Event Creation Flow

1. Artist creates an event through the web interface
2. Web app calls the EventFactory contract
3. Contract creates an event PDA and mints the initial RTA NFT
4. Event metadata is uploaded to IPFS
5. CID is stored on-chain in the event account

### Streaming Flow

1. Artist starts streaming via browser or OBS
2. Stream is received by RTMP ingest server
3. Stream is transcoded into multiple qualities
4. Stream is chunked into 10-second segments
5. Chunks are uploaded to IPFS
6. Manifest file is updated with new chunk CIDs
7. Manifest CID is updated on-chain

### Viewing Flow

1. User purchases a ticket via the TicketFactory contract
2. User enters the event room
3. Ticket ownership is verified on-chain
4. Client fetches the manifest CID from the blockchain
5. Client retrieves the manifest from IPFS
6. Client generates an HLS playlist from the manifest
7. Video player loads and plays the content

### Tipping Flow

1. User sends a tip through the web interface
2. Web app calls the LiveTipping contract
3. Contract processes the tip and updates the highest tipper if applicable
4. Tip is broadcast to the chat service
5. UI updates to reflect the new tip and total

### Event Finalization Flow

1. Artist ends the event
2. EventFactory contract is called to finalize the event
3. Contract distributes tips according to the distribution model
4. RTA NFT is transferred to the highest tipper
5. Event status is updated to "finalized"

## Multi-Room Architecture

The platform supports multiple concurrent events through:

### Room Isolation

1. **Unique Identifiers**: Each event has a unique ID
2. **Dedicated Resources**: Separate streaming and chat instances
3. **Access Control**: Ticket verification for each room

### Resource Allocation

1. **Dynamic Scaling**: Resources scale based on demand
2. **Load Balancing**: Distributes traffic across servers
3. **Priority Tiers**: Premium events get priority resources

### Concurrent Events

1. **Independent Processing**: Events are processed independently
2. **Shared Infrastructure**: Common infrastructure with logical separation
3. **Cross-Event Discovery**: Users can discover other active events

## Security Measures

### Blockchain Security

1. **Program Validation**: Rigorous testing and auditing of smart contracts
2. **Access Control**: Clear permission structure for contract interactions
3. **Secure Key Management**: Hardware security for deployment keys

### Content Security

1. **Content Verification**: Verify CIDs before displaying content
2. **Access Control**: On-chain verification of ticket ownership
3. **Content Moderation**: Reporting system for inappropriate content

### Infrastructure Security

1. **DDoS Protection**: Cloud-based DDoS mitigation
2. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent API abuse
3. **Encryption**: TLS for all communications
4. **Firewall Rules**: Strict firewall configurations

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling

1. **Stateless Services**: Services designed for horizontal scaling
2. **Containerization**: Docker containers for consistent deployment
3. **Kubernetes**: Orchestration for automatic scaling

### Vertical Scaling

1. **Resource Optimization**: Efficient use of server resources
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring and optimization
3. **Hardware Upgrades**: Strategic hardware improvements

### Content Delivery

1. **Edge Caching**: Content cached at edge locations
2. **IPFS Gateway Selection**: Dynamic selection of fastest gateway
3. **Parallel Downloads**: Multiple concurrent chunk downloads

## Monitoring and Analytics

### System Monitoring

1. **Infrastructure Metrics**: CPU, memory, network usage
2. **Application Metrics**: Response times, error rates
3. **Blockchain Metrics**: Transaction success rates, gas usage

### Business Analytics

1. **User Engagement**: Viewership, retention, interaction
2. **Financial Metrics**: Tips, ticket sales, platform fees
3. **Artist Performance**: Audience growth, tip frequency

### Alerting System

1. **Threshold Alerts**: Notifications when metrics exceed thresholds
2. **Anomaly Detection**: AI-based detection of unusual patterns
3. **On-Call Rotation**: 24/7 coverage for critical issues

## Deployment Strategy

### Environment Separation

1. **Development**: For active development and testing
2. **Staging**: For pre-production validation
3. **Production**: For end-user access

### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment

1. **Automated Testing**: Unit, integration, and end-to-end tests
2. **Deployment Pipelines**: Automated deployment workflows
3. **Rollback Capability**: Quick recovery from failed deployments

### Infrastructure as Code

1. **Terraform**: Infrastructure defined as code
2. **Configuration Management**: Ansible for configuration
3. **Version Control**: All infrastructure code in version control

## Conclusion

The Haus platform architecture combines decentralized and centralized components to create a robust, scalable system for Real-Time Assets. By leveraging the strengths of blockchain for ownership and value transfer, IPFS for permanent storage, and centralized services for performance and user experience, we've created a platform that delivers the best of both worlds to artists and collectors.

This architecture enables the unique value proposition of RTAs while ensuring a seamless, high-performance experience for all users. As the platform grows, the modular design allows for scaling individual components and adding new features without disrupting the core functionality.
